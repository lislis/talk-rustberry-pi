      - no background or experience in bare metal programming (aside from toying with Arduinos)

      - no idea what I'm doing

      - a rough idea of what I want

      ## Prep work

      --

      - Develop on device

        - Flash Raspbian OS onto an SD card and boot your Raspy
        - Use the GUI or ssh to install Rust (with rustup, just like you're used to)
        - [Video tutorial on how to do these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMzCfzCUNyo)

      - or cross-compile
        - add ARM target (`rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`)
        - [Article on how to do that and set up a deployment script](https://medium.com/swlh/compiling-rust-for-raspberry-pi-arm-922b55dbb050)

      ## Building a circuit for the example!

      We need:

      - Jumper cables

      - LED

      - Resistor (eg 330 Ohm)

      - Breadboard
