      ## Prep work

      --

      - Develop on device

        - Flash Raspbian OS onto an SD card and boot your Raspy
        - Use the GUI or ssh to install Rust (with rustup, just like you're used to)
        - [Video tutorial on how to do these things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMzCfzCUNyo)

      - or cross-compile
        - add ARM target (`rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`)
        - [Article on how to do that and set up a deployment script](https://medium.com/swlh/compiling-rust-for-raspberry-pi-arm-922b55dbb050)

      ## Building a circuit for the blinking light!

      We need:

      - Jumper cables

      - LED

      - Resistor (eg 330 Ohm)

      - Breadboard

      ## Building a circuit for the blinking light!

      - Connect 5V and GND on your breadboard

      - Connect the long leg of the LED to GPIO 23 (physical pin 16)

      - Connect the short leg to GND using the resistor

      ---

      Step 2

      ## Hello touchy World

      ---

      class: middle

      ## Building a circuit for the touch sensor

      - Connect 5V and GND on your breadboard

      - The touch sensor module has three pins

        - Connect VCC and GND to your breadboard accordingly

        - Connect Out to GPIO 24 (physical pin 18)

      Look at the code and run it!

      ## Building a circuit for a servo motor

      - Connect 5V and GND on your breadboard

      - The servo motor has three pins

        - Connect VCC (red) and GND (brown) to your breadboard accordingly <br> .small[(ideally motors are powered by a seperate power supply as they draw a lot of current. But we'll ignore that for now üôÉ)]

        - Connect the Pulse (orange) to GPIO 18 (physical pin 12) <br> .small[(and make sure that your Pi has [pwm enabled](https://docs.golemparts.com/rppal/0.12.0/rppal/pwm/index.html#pwm-channels))]
